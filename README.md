**⚙️ End-to-end CI/CD pipeline for a Java application using Gradle, GitHub Actions, and Docker**

This repository demonstrates a modern DevOps workflow that automates the build, test, and deployment lifecycle of a Java application. It leverages **☕ Java** for development, **🛠️ Gradle** for build automation, **🤖 GitHub Actions** for CI/CD, and **🐳 Docker** for containerized delivery — ensuring every code push becomes a production-ready image.
